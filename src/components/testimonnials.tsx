He has the ability to turn complex concepts into user-friendly, visually appealing websites. His attention to detail and commitment to delivering high-quality work are truly commendable. I had the privilege of working with Surendar on various projects during his tenure at Flookup, and I was continually impressed by his problem-solving abilities and the way he tackled challenges. If you are seeking a web developer who not only possesses technical expertise but also a strong work ethic and a passion for delivering results, I wholeheartedly recommend Surendar is an asset to any team or project.",

I had some custom requirements like only one video being played at a time, mobile optimising, etc. They got the job done, and even built a sweet front-end system that allows a tech noob like me to manage future video testimonials. Thanks for doing a fantastic job - big fan and can recommend to anyone needing web/tech/code firepower!",
